# Bloxberg-Business-Sim

This is a lab by Dalton Murray for Object Oriented Programming under Professor Whiteley.

The this command was used to associate the variables inside of different classes to the variables that are being passed in whenever the class and the associated method is called.

Method Overloading was used in the Business class in order to associate values for variables in the event that the variable isn't filled in during input.

In this program, static fields were used to keep consistency with the number of businesses and the tax rate being charged.
